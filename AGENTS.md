## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains a custom ROM for the N64 game **GoldenEye 007** with various utilities for practicing speedruns. It is a fork of a work-in-progress, byte-matching decompilation of the original N64 game. It compiles C source files and assembly files back into `.z64` ROM binaries.

## 3. Build Commands

All builds must be run inside Docker since the host environment is macOS. Use the `goldeneye` Docker image to compile the ROMs.

### Standard Compilations

- **Build NTSC-US ROM (with Parallel Jobs)**:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/dev goldeneye make -j8
    ```
- **Clean Build Files**:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/dev goldeneye make clean
    ```

### Build Variables

You can configure Makefile behavior by passing the following flags (e.g., `make VARIABLE=VALUE`):

- `DEV`: `1` (disable optimizations, add dev code), `0` (prod build, default)
- `VERSION`: `US` (default), `JP`, `EU`
- `COMPARE`: `1` (compare ROM checksum against targets), `0` (disable comparison for custom builds, default)
- `IDO_RECOMP`: `YES` (default, uses fast natively compiled IDO C compiler), `NO` (uses QEMU to emulate the original IRIX binary)
- `FINAL`: `YES` (default), `NO` (builds non-working debug version of the decomp)
- `VERBOSE`: `0` (quiet, default), `1` (prints full command lines)

## 4. Guide to Key Source Files

When tasked with modification or analysis of gameplay, look here first:

- **Cheats & Inputs**:
    - `src/game/cheat_buttons.c` / `src/game/cheat_buttons.h`: Handles controller combination checks, cheat menu bindings, and cheat activations.
- **Practice**:
    - `src/practice`: Folder containing utilities for speedrun practice. All new logic goes in files here. This is not in the original game.
- **Weapon Logic**:
    - `src/game/gun.c` / `src/game/gun.h`: Massive file handling shooting, aiming, projectile calculations, reloading, and weapon state.
- **Player Physics & Camera**:
    - `src/game/player.c` / `src/game/player.h`: Player movement state machine, health, coordinates, and controls.
    - `src/game/bondview.c`: Heavy rendering, camera coordinates, and HUD logic.
- **Linker & Memory Map**:
    - `ge007.ld`: Top-level linker specification arranging code segments and overlays.
    - `ld/`: Segment definitions specifying BSS/text/rodata address overlays.

All new logic for the practice ROM is stored in the files under `src/practice`. If logic needs to be added to existing files, it should be added within an `#ifdef PRACTICE_ROM` block. If any lines are modified, the modified lines should exist in the `#ifdef` block with the original still existing, unmodified in the `#else` block. This is so that changes to the original code are easy to find and compare to original. `#include` directives do not need to be in `#ifdef` blocks.

## 5. Assembly & C Integration (GLOBAL_ASM)

The codebase heavily utilizes standard decompilation patterns to bridge C with yet-unmatched assembly code.

- If a function has not yet been decompiled to C, it is referenced via the preprocessor macro:
    ```c
    #pragma GLOBAL_ASM("asm/nonmatchings/game/some_file/some_func.s")
    ```
- The python preprocessor `tools/asm-processor/asm_processor.py` intercepts this during compile, compiles the `.s` file, and stabs the generated object code directly into the compiled C unit to allow matching builds.

---

## 6. Adding New Source Files

When adding a new `.c` file, Makefile will automatically pick it up but it must be added manually to the linker scripts at:

- `ld/game.text.ld.inc`
- `ld/game.data.ld.inc`
- `ld/game.bss.ld.inc`
- `ld/game.rodata.ld.inc`

## Debugging

1. Build the ROM with debug symbols:
    - `just make` (`make-dev` build currently broken)
2. Start the ares emulator
    - `/Applications/ares.app/Contents/MacOS/ares ./build/u/ge007.u.z64`
    - This will start a GDB server on localhost:9123 which you can connect to while the emulator is running
    - You can set the emulator to start at a certain level and skip the intro then trigger things to happen n frames after load in practice_debug.c
    - You typically need to run the emulator for up to 10 seconds before the level loads and longer for whatever you want to trigger
    - You can use the `emu_log` function to log things to the emulator's STDOUT
    - If you stop this command the emulator will quit!
    - If you do run the emulator in the background remember to kill it later
3. Use the GDB MCP tools to connect
    - See the settings in `.vscode/launch.json` for how to connect
    - Note that the IDO compiler is old and does NOT produce debug symbols so only function breakpoints (not lines) work (except for the newly added src/practice files which are compiled using GCC)
    - You will also not be able to see variables and must look at the memory address pointed to by pointer arguments in the CPU registers
