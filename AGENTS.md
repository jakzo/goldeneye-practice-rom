## 1. Project Overview
This repository contains a custom ROM for the N64 game **GoldenEye 007** with various utilities for practicing speedruns. It is a fork of a work-in-progress, byte-matching decompilation of the original N64 game. It compiles C source files and assembly files back into `.z64` ROM binaries.

Below is the high-level layout of the repository and where components are located:

## 3. Build Commands

All builds must be run inside Docker since the host environment is macOS. Use the `goldeneye` Docker image to compile the ROMs.

### Standard Compilations
* **Build NTSC-US ROM (with Parallel Jobs)**:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/dev goldeneye make -j4 COMPARE=0
  ```
* **Clean Build Files**:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home/dev goldeneye make clean
  ```

### Build Variables
You can configure Makefile behavior by passing the following flags (e.g., `make VARIABLE=VALUE`):
* `VERSION`: `US` (default), `JP`, `EU`
* `COMPARE`: `1` (compare ROM checksum against targets, default), `0` (disable comparison for custom builds)
* `IDO_RECOMP`: `YES` (default, uses fast natively compiled IDO C compiler), `NO` (uses QEMU to emulate the original IRIX binary)
* `FINAL`: `YES` (optimizes code using `-O2`, default), `NO` (builds debug version)
* `VERBOSE`: `0` (quiet, default), `1` (prints full command lines)

## 4. Guide to Key Source Files

When tasked with modification or analysis of gameplay, look here first:

* **Cheats & Inputs**:
  * `src/game/cheat_buttons.c` / `src/game/cheat_buttons.h`: Handles controller combination checks, cheat menu bindings, and cheat activations.
* **Practice**:
  * `src/practice`: Folder containing utilities for speedrun practice. All new logic goes in files here. This is not in the original game.
* **Weapon Logic**:
  * `src/game/gun.c` / `src/game/gun.h`: Massive file handling shooting, aiming, projectile calculations, reloading, and weapon state.
* **Player Physics & Camera**:
  * `src/game/player.c` / `src/game/player.h`: Player movement state machine, health, coordinates, and controls.
  * `src/game/bondview.c`: Heavy rendering, camera coordinates, and HUD logic.
* **Linker & Memory Map**:
  * `ge007.ld`: Top-level linker specification arranging code segments and overlays.
  * `ld/`: Segment definitions specifying BSS/text/rodata address overlays.

All new logic for the practice ROM is stored in the files under `src/practice`. If logic needs to be added to existing files, it should be added within an `#ifdef PRACTICE_ROM` block. If any lines are modified, the modified lines should exist in the `#ifdef` block with the original still existing, unmodified in the `#else` block. This is so that changes to the original code are easy to find and compare to original. `#include` directives do not need to be in `#ifdef` blocks.

## 5. Assembly & C Integration (GLOBAL_ASM)
The codebase heavily utilizes standard decompilation patterns to bridge C with yet-unmatched assembly code.
* If a function has not yet been decompiled to C, it is referenced via the preprocessor macro:
  ```c
  #pragma GLOBAL_ASM("asm/nonmatchings/game/some_file/some_func.s")
  ```
* The python preprocessor `tools/asm-processor/asm_processor.py` intercepts this during compile, compiles the `.s` file, and stabs the generated object code directly into the compiled C unit to allow matching builds.
