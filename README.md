# Goldeneye N64 practice rom

This ROM provides tools for practicing speedruns of Goldeneye 007 on the Nintendo 64.

## How to install

- Download the latest `.xdelta` patch from [the releases page](https://github.com/jakzo/goldeneneye-practice-rom/releases)
- Acquire an unmodified base ROM of the US NTSC version of Goldeneye
- Use a ROM patcher tool such as [this one](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/) and apply the patch to the base ROM
- Run your modified ROM on:
    - Emulator:
        - Any should work though I recommend [ares](https://ares-emu.net/download) for its accuracy
    - Nintendo 64:
        - [SummerCart64](https://summercart64.dev/)
        - [EverDrive 64](https://krikzz.com/our-products/cartridges/ed64x7.html)
        - Copy the ROM to either of these via the micro SD card or USB

## Features

- **Timer displayed during gameplay**
- **End screen timer displays hundredths**
- **Time scale control**
    - During gameplay press `L + D-Left` to decrease game speed by 10%
    - During gameplay press `L + D-Right` to increase game speed by 10%
- **Speedometer**
    - Displays Bond's current horizontal movement speed (moving up and down does not affect the displayed speed)
- **Lag estimate**
    - Displays the amount of lag and estimated effect
    - The format looks like `+0.6 (2)` where:
        - `(2)` means there were 2 dropped frames before the current one was rendered
        - `+0.6` means that if you were strafe-running at max speed for 100 meters (slightly less than the length of the start of the runway to the plane in Runway) you would have taken 0.6 seconds longer than if there were 0 dropped frames
- **Skip level intro cutscenes**
    - Starting a level goes straight into it, rather than playing the intro cutscene
- **Skips legal and logo screens on game startup**
- **Save automatically fully unlocked**
    - On booting the ROM for the first time the default save will have all levels and cheats unlocked

### Level features

- **Dam**
    - Indicator for when the gate guard has loaded in
    - Option to never play the gate intro cutscene
- **Runway**
    - Splits

### ℹ️ Beta features

These features have some minor bugs or limitations but should be usable:

- **Save states**
    - During gameplay press `L + D-Down` to save current state
    - During gameplay press `L + D-Up` to load current state
    - There are several minor visual/audio pieces of state which are not saved or loaded but should not affect gameplay
        - If there is some state not saved that DOES affect gameplay, let me know (@jakzo on Discord)
    - Not fully stable, expect occassional crashes
        - If you can reliably reproduce the crash, let me know so I can fix it (@jakzo on Discord)
- **Grenade camera**
    - When throwing grenades, shows a picture-in-picture view that follows the grenade so you can see where it landed
