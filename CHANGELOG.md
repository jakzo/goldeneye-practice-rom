- [alpha] **Save states**
    - During gameplay press `L + D-Down` to save current state
    - During gameplay press `L + D-Up` to load current state
    - Note that many bits of state do not yet get restored, like killed guards and destroyed props
- [alpha] **Grenade camera**
    - When throwing grenades, shows a picture-in-picture view that follows the grenade so you can see where it landed
- **Skip level intro cutscenes**
    - Starting a level goes straight into it, rather than playing the intro cutscene
- **Skips legal and logo screens on game startup**
- [beta] **Time scale control**
    - During gameplay press `L + D-Left` to decrease game speed by 10%
    - During gameplay press `L + D-Right` to increase game speed by 10%
