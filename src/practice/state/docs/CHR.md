# Character Prop State

This document covers the incremental save/load support for `PROP_TYPE_CHR`,
the final prop type. `ChrRecord` owns a character's AI, combat, movement, damage, and
render-facing state. Its top-level layout is documented in
[`PROPS.md`](PROPS.md#4-chrrecord-prop_type_chr); this file documents the
supporting structs stored in or referenced by that record.

## Current implementation boundary

Every CHR payload starts with allocation metadata:

```c
ChrAllocationState::headnum; /* Signed head model index; -1 means body-owned head. */
ChrAllocationState::bodynum; /* Signed body model index. */
ChrAllocationState::heading; /* Initial model Y heading in radians. */
```

With `ADD_AND_REMOVE_PROPS == FALSE`, this header is consumed but the existing
active CHR allocation is retained. With the flag enabled, the current CHR at
the saved prop index is fully torn down, a body/head model is allocated with
`retrieve_header_for_body_and_head`, and `init_GUARDdata_with_set_values`
establishes a new `ChrRecord`/`Model`/`PropRecord` relationship before any
payload fields are applied. CHRs in enabled prop slots absent from the save are
cleaned up and released. The flag remains disabled until all prop types and
the remaining CHR initialization state are supported.

The first CHR serialization slice is implemented. It restores only the
following scalar behavior parameters:

```c
ChrRecord::accuracyrating; /* Signed shooting-accuracy adjustment (-128..127). */
ChrRecord::speedrating;    /* Signed reaction/movement-speed adjustment (-128..127). */
ChrRecord::arghrating;     /* Signed damage-reaction-speed adjustment (-128..127). */
ChrRecord::grenadeprob;    /* Grenade-attempt threshold (0..255). */
ChrRecord::visionrange;    /* Maximum visual-detection distance. */
ChrRecord::hearingscale;   /* Hearing-distance multiplier; initialized to 1.0. */
ChrRecord::morale;         /* AI-script morale byte, 0-255. */
ChrRecord::alertness;      /* AI-script alertness byte, 0-255. */
```

These values are self-contained inputs to AI calculations. Restoring them does
not change prop allocation, linked lists, pointers, animation state, collision
state, model state, or the current AI instruction. This makes them a
conservative first slice.

The second CHR serialization slice restores the following scalar AI-memory
fields:

```c
ChrRecord::numarghs;      /* Confirmed hit-reaction count, 0 initially. */
ChrRecord::numclosearghs; /* Near-miss/close-hit count, 0 initially. */
ChrRecord::random;        /* Latched AI random byte, 0-255. */
ChrRecord::padpreset1;    /* Resolved stage pad ID, or -1 when unset. */
ChrRecord::chrpreset1;    /* Resolved character ID, or -1 when unset. */
ChrRecord::chrseeshot;    /* Character seen being shot, or CHR_FREE (-1). */
ChrRecord::chrseedie;     /* Character seen dying, or CHR_FREE (-1). */
```

`numarghs` increments when a character enters a confirmed damage reaction and
is compared by the `IFMyNumArghs*` AI commands. `numclosearghs` is exposed to
the equivalent close-argh commands; its increment path remains unidentified
in the current decompilation, so its exact near-miss semantics are TODO.

`random` is updated only when `AI_SetNewRandom` runs and is reused by random,
morale, and alertness branches until replaced. Restoring it preserves the
saved branch input without advancing either global random seed.

`padpreset1` is the concrete pad substituted for `PAD_PRESET1` (`9000`).
`chrpreset1` is the concrete character ID substituted for `CHR_PRESET` (`-4`).
The preset fields contain IDs rather than pointers, so they remain valid while
loading within the same level.

`chrseeshot` and `chrseedie` contain the character ID propagated to nearby
guards when a character is shot or dies. AI resolves `CHR_SEE_SHOT` (`-6`) and
`CHR_SEE_DIE` (`-5`) through these fields. Both initialize to and are reset to
`CHR_FREE` (`-1`) after an AI action tick, so nonnegative values are transient
but valid save-state data.

The third CHR serialization slice restores the character's perception memory:

```c
ChrRecord::lastseetarget60;      /* Global tick of the last visual detection. */
ChrRecord::lastknowntargetpos;   /* Remembered target world position. */
ChrRecord::targetTile;           /* StandTile containing that position. */
ChrRecord::seen_bond_time;       /* Global tick of the last direct Bond sighting. */
ChrRecord::lastheartarget60;     /* Global tick of the last auditory detection. */
```

The three time fields are absolute `g_GlobalTimer` values, not elapsed
durations. Zero means no recorded detection. `chrSawTargetRecently` and
`chrHeardTargetRecently` treat a timestamp as recent for 600 NTSC ticks or 500
PAL ticks (ten seconds). `seen_bond_time` is also checked against the most
recent 120 NTSC or 100 PAL ticks while deciding whether a guard may fire.
These timestamps remain coherent because `g_GlobalTimer` is restored by the
global-state payload.

Both visual and auditory alerts copy Bond's current position into
`lastknowntargetpos` and his stand tile into `targetTile`. `targetTile` is
serialized as a byte offset from `standTileStart`, not as an address. A saved
offset is stable because save states can only be loaded into the same level;
`-1` represents `NULL`.

The fourth CHR serialization slice restores these independent runtime fields:

```c
ChrRecord::chrnum;       /* Runtime character ID. */
ChrRecord::flags2;       /* Complete secondary AI-script flag byte. */
ChrRecord::timer60;      /* Per-character AI timer value. */
CHRHIDDEN_TIMER_ACTIVE;  /* Timer running/paused control bit only. */
ChrRecord::shotbondsum;  /* Fractional accumulated damage against Bond. */
ChrRecord::shadecol;     /* Current four-channel tile-lighting colour. */
ChrRecord::nextcol;      /* Target four-channel tile-lighting colour. */
```

`chrnum` is the character's runtime identity used by `chrFindById` and AI
character selectors. It is normally a nonnegative level-assigned ID, can be
replaced by `AI_SetMyChrNum`, and uses signed 16-bit storage. Restoring all
surviving CHRs returns their script-visible identities to the saved values.

`flags2` is restored as a complete byte. AI commands set, unset, and test
arbitrary masks in this field. Known bits are `FLAGS2_DONT_POINT_AT_BOND`
(`0x01`), unknown/script-reserved `FLAGS2_02` (`0x02`), and `FLAGS2_04`
(`0x04`), which alarm AI uses as persistent state. The remaining bits are
available to script masks but have no documented built-in meaning.

`timer60` initializes to zero and increments by `g_ClockTimer` only while
`CHRHIDDEN_TIMER_ACTIVE` (`0x0040`) is set. AI can start, reset, pause, resume,
and compare this timer. The timer value and active bit are restored together,
but only that bit is merged into `hidden`; all unrelated `hidden` state is
preserved. Restoring the whole `hidden` field is unsafe until removal, firing,
movement, freeze, background-AI, and action state are coordinated.

`shotbondsum` is a fractional damage accumulator used while guard fire is
calculated. It initializes to `0.0`, accumulates accuracy-adjusted contributions
and normally remains below `1.0`; reaching `1.0` applies damage to Bond and
resets it to zero.

`shadecol` is the current character lighting colour and `nextcol` is the target
calculated from the character's stand tile. Both are `rgba_u8` values with four
channels in the range 0-255. They are restored as a pair so an in-progress
lighting transition remains internally consistent.

The fifth CHR serialization slice restores the AI interpreter state:

```c
ChrRecord::ailist;       /* Active AI command list, encoded by stable list ID. */
ChrRecord::aioffset;     /* Byte offset of the next command in that list. */
ChrRecord::aireturnlist; /* AI list ID used by the Return command. */
ChrRecord::sleep;        /* Ticks before the next AI/action update. */
```

`ailist` is a pointer into static global or level setup data and is never saved
as an address. `chraiGetAIListID` converts it to its stable ID and
`ailistFindById` resolves that ID on load. Global list IDs occupy `0-1024`,
level character lists occupy `1025-4095`, and background lists start at
`4096`. ID `0` is valid, so the serialized null/not-found sentinel is `-1`.

`aioffset` is an unsigned 16-bit byte offset to the next command within
`ailist`. It is updated when an AI list yields. The same-ROM, same-level load
restriction guarantees that saved command boundaries still describe the
resolved list.

`aireturnlist` is a signed 16-bit stable list ID used by `AI_Return`; `-1`
means no return list has been assigned. It does not contain an address.

`sleep` is a signed eight-bit tick delay. Positive values postpone AI and
action processing and are normally capped at 127; it is decremented by
`g_ClockTimer`, and reaching a negative value permits the next AI update. This
field also spaces some animation/action updates, so it is restored with the
interpreter state rather than independently.

The sixth CHR serialization slice restores spatial and movement state as one
unit:

```c
PropRecord::pos;              /* Current world position. */
PropRecord::stan;             /* Current StandTile, encoded as a byte offset. */
PropRecord::rooms[4];         /* 0xFF-terminated occupied-room IDs. */
ChrRecord::invalidmove;       /* Whether the most recent move failed. */
ChrRecord::sumground;         /* Ground-height accumulator. */
ChrRecord::manground;         /* Companion/manual ground-height value. */
ChrRecord::ground;            /* Supporting floor's world Y coordinate. */
ChrRecord::fallspeed;         /* Current X/Y/Z fall or impact velocity. */
ChrRecord::prevpos;           /* Previous model-root world position. */
ChrRecord::lastwalk60;        /* Last travel-update g_GlobalTimer tick. */
ChrRecord::lastmoveok60;      /* Last successful-move g_GlobalTimer tick. */
ChrRecord::collision_bounds;  /* Four-point X/Z collision diamond. */
Model root offset;            /* Current rendered model world position. */
Model root heading;           /* Current Y-axis heading in radians. */
```

`PropRecord::pos` and the model root offset are both three finite floating-point
world coordinates. They normally agree after a character tick, but both are
saved because animation processing owns the model root and copies it into the
prop. The root heading is an angle in radians, normally normalized to
`0 <= heading < 2*pi`. The simple-action slice described below additionally
restores the complete pointer-free root working record while its action is
supported.

`stan` is serialized as a byte offset from `standTileStart`; `-1` represents
`NULL`. This is stable under the existing same-level restriction. `rooms`
contains up to three room IDs in the range 0-254 followed by `0xff`. Loading
first deregisters the active prop from its old rooms, replaces all four room
bytes and its stand tile, then registers it in the restored rooms.

`invalidmove` is set to `0` when travel starts or succeeds and `1` on a failed
movement attempt. Patrol, go-position, and run-position actions use it to
decide whether to stop or reconsider a route.

`ground` is the world Y coordinate of the supporting floor, not a distance
above it. `fallspeed` is the character's three-component falling or
impact-motion velocity and initializes to `(0, 0, 0)`. `sumground` and
`manground` also initialize to `0.0`; their exact ground-smoothing roles are
not exposed by the currently decompiled C, so naming their individual
semantics remains TODO. They are restored with `ground` because all three form
the contiguous ground-motion state.

`prevpos` records the model root before the previous movement/animation tick.
Travel actions compare it with the current prop position to detect crossing a
destination. `lastwalk60` and `lastmoveok60` are absolute `g_GlobalTimer`
ticks: the former records recent travel processing, while the latter is
refreshed after a valid move and is tested to detect a stuck route. Zero is the
initial/no-walk value for `lastwalk60`; `lastmoveok60` initializes to the
current global timer.

`collision_bounds` contains four X/Z coordinate pairs. For an ordinary CHR,
they form a diamond centered on `prop->pos` with points at plus/minus
`chrwidth` on each axis. Saving the live values also preserves any
action-specific bound update until the engine calculates them again.

The seventh CHR serialization slice restores equipment and its attachment
ownership:

```c
ChrRecord::weapons_held[0];        /* Right-hand weapon prop, or NULL. */
ChrRecord::weapons_held[1];        /* Left-hand weapon prop, or NULL. */
ChrRecord::weapons_held[2];        /* Legacy unused slot; normally NULL. */
ChrRecord::handle_positiondata_hat;/* Headwear prop, or NULL. */
ChrAttachmentIndices::weapon_model[2]; /* Weapon model IDs for recreation. */
ChrAttachmentIndices::weaponnum[2];    /* ITEM_IDS values for recreation. */
ChrAttachmentIndices::weapon_flags[2]; /* Object setup flags for recreation. */
ChrAttachmentIndices::hat_model;       /* Hat model ID for recreation. */
ChrAttachmentIndices::hat_flags;       /* Hat object setup flags. */
PropRecord::parent;                /* Owning CHR prop for attached equipment. */
PropRecord::child/prev/next;       /* CHR child/sibling attachment links. */
ObjectRecord::runtime_bitflags;    /* RUNTIMEBITFLAG_HASOWNER ownership bit. */
Model::attachedto;                 /* Owning CHR model. */
Model::attachedto_objinst;         /* Hand/head model switch node. */
```

The four CHR pointers are encoded as signed prop-array indices: `-1` means
`NULL`, while `0..POS_DATA_ENTRY_LEN-1` identifies a `PropRecord`. They are
resolved only after all prop payloads have loaded. Held equipment is normally
disabled and therefore does not appear as a standalone enabled-prop payload.
A hand entry is accepted when the indexed prop still has a matching live
`PROPDEF_COLLECTABLE` object/model and a correct object-to-prop back-pointer.
The hat entry additionally requires `PROPDEF_HAT`. Missing, mismatched, reused,
or duplicate targets are resolved to `NULL`.

Held equipment is disabled while attached, so it is not guaranteed to have a
standalone enabled-prop record in the save. The allocation metadata therefore
also stores each hand weapon's object model ID, `ITEM_IDS` value, and complete
object setup flags, plus the hat model ID and flags. In replacement mode, a
missing weapon is recreated with `chrGiveWeapon` and a missing hat with
`hatCreateForChr`; the returned props replace the unresolved saved indices.
Testing mode never invokes these constructors.

`weapons_held[0]` and `[1]` are selected by `GUNRIGHT` (`0`) and `GUNLEFT`
(`1`). `weapons_held[2]` is initialized to `NULL` and has no readers or
writers beyond initialization in the current decompilation. It is retained
for layout compatibility and restored only if the referenced prop is already
a child of the CHR; no attachment-node semantics are inferred for it.
`handle_positiondata_hat` is the independently used headwear pointer.

An attached prop uses `parent` for the owning CHR. In this state, `prev` and
`next` are attachment-sibling links and `parent->child` points to the newest
child. When `parent` is `NULL`, `prev` and `next` instead belong to the global
active-prop list. Restoration therefore uses `chrpropDetach`,
`chrpropDelist`, `chrpropActivate`, and `chrpropReparent` rather than assigning
these pointers independently. Equipment held after the save but absent from
the saved slots is detached and returned to the active list; saved equipment
which was dropped later is removed from its rooms and active list before being
reattached.

The equipment model's `attachedto` points to the live CHR model.
`attachedto_objinst` selects model switch `3` for the right hand, `5` for the
left hand, and `6` for the head/hat. Attached objects also receive
`RUNTIMEBITFLAG_HASOWNER` (`0x00080000`) and are disabled while parented.
Reattaching a weapon dropped after the save clears stale
`RUNTIMEBITFLAG_DEPOSIT`/`RUNTIMEBITFLAG_EMBEDDED` state because the associated
projectile and embedment pools have already been restored independently.
Detaching clears ownership and the attachment node, then activates and enables
the prop in the world. Together these fields make rendering, dropping, firing,
and hat-hit handling agree with the CHR pointer fields.

The eighth CHR serialization slice restores the first action batch and its
live model-animation controller:

```c
ChrRecord::actiontype;       /* ACT_STAND, SIDESTEP, JUMPOUT, RUNPOS, SURPRISED. */
ChrRecord::act_stand;        /* Active stand-facing and wall-check fields. */
ChrRecord::act_runpos;       /* Destination, arrival distance, ETA, turn speed. */
Model::anim, anim2;          /* Animation-table identities, encoded as offsets. */
Model primary/merge frames;  /* Current frame pairs and fractional positions. */
Model speed state;           /* Current/target/old speed and interpolation clocks. */
Model loop state;            /* Loop enable, loop frame, and loop merge duration. */
Model play-speed state;      /* Current/target play rate and interpolation clocks. */
Model root RW data;          /* Pointer-free animation translation/heading state. */
```

Only those five action discriminators are applied. Saving any other action
writes no action/model payload, and loading it leaves the destination action
live; its union cannot safely be interpreted until the corresponding batch is
implemented.

`Model::anim` and `anim2` point into the permanent `ptr_animation_table`.
They are serialized as signed byte offsets from `ptr_animation_table->data`;
`-1` represents `NULL`. This reconstructs valid pointers for both an existing
model and a model newly allocated by the gated replacement path. No saved
address or existing-model identity is reused.

The primary frame is represented by `framea`, `frameb`, `unk28` (the current
fractional frame), and `unk2c` (the interpolation fraction). The merge/previous
animation uses the corresponding `frame2a`, `frame2b`, `unk58`, and `unk5c`
fields. Frame values are signed 16-bit animation-frame indices and must remain
within the selected animation. `endframe` and `unk6c` are end-frame overrides;
`-1.0` means use the animation's natural final frame.

`speed` is the current frame advance per animation tick. `newspeed`,
`oldspeed`, `timespeed`, and `elapsespeed` describe an in-progress speed
transition. The equivalent secondary-animation values, loop controls,
merge weights/clocks, `playspeed`, and play-speed transition fields are
restored together because advancing only part of this controller can select
different frames after loading. Cached decoded-frame slots are not serialized;
matrix calculation regenerates them from the restored animation and frame
indices. `animflipfunc` is cleared rather than treated as data because it is a
function pointer and no GoldenEye caller installs one for these CHR actions.

Character models use a `MODELNODE_OPCODE_HEADER` root whose
`ModelRwData_HeaderRecord` contains only bytes, coordinates, angles, and
interpolation values. The complete record is copied after resolving the model
allocation. This includes the primary and merge translation/heading working
values that `modelSetAnimation` normally initializes, so replacement mode does
not assume that the destination model was already playing the saved animation.

The payload is implemented in `practice_states_chr.c` and dispatched by
`practice_states_props.c`. For CHRs, only the spatial subset of the common
`PropRecord` payload (`pos`, `stan`, and `rooms`) is restored. The remaining
common fields stay live until their dependencies are implemented.

Do not include the following in the implemented slices:

- `damage`, `maxdamage`, unsupported action-union data, unsupported
  `actiontype` values, or flags. Those values have coupled state which must be
  investigated and restored together.
- The complete `hidden` and `chrflags` fields. They contain action-coupled and
  destructive bits which must be restored with character action, model,
  movement, damage, and allocation state.
- `field_20`. Despite its earlier tentative pathfinding label, its consumers
  identify it as a dynamically allocated skeletal joint/matrix render list.
  Its address is process-local and must be reconstructed or cleared with
  allocation/model support.

The normal testing path still requires the same enabled CHR prop to exist.
The gated replacement path does not retain its `ChrRecord` or `Model`
back-pointers: it recreates them first, then applies spatial/model state and
resolves attachments against the rebuilt prop table. Allocation currently uses
zero model spawn flags, so model variants represented only by spawn flags must
be added to `ChrAllocationState` before `ADD_AND_REMOVE_PROPS` is enabled.

## Action discriminator

`ChrRecord::actiontype` selects exactly one member of the action union. Valid
runtime values are:

```c
typedef enum ACT_TYPE {
    ACT_INIT = 0,         /* Newly created; initialize on a later tick. */
    ACT_STAND = 1,        /* Idle, turning, aiming, or facing a target. */
    ACT_KNEEL = 2,        /* Kneeling transition/pose. */
    ACT_ANIM = 3,         /* AI-requested scripted animation. */
    ACT_DIE = 4,          /* Active death animation and impulses. */
    ACT_DEAD = 5,         /* Corpse fade/reap state. */
    ACT_ARGH = 6,         /* Immediate hit reaction. */
    ACT_PREARGH = 7,      /* Deferred hit reaction. */
    ACT_ATTACK = 8,       /* Stationary attack. */
    ACT_ATTACKWALK = 9,   /* Attack while moving. */
    ACT_ATTACKROLL = 10,  /* Attack during an evasive roll. */
    ACT_SIDESTEP = 11,    /* Lateral dodge. */
    ACT_JUMPOUT = 12,     /* Jump out from cover. */
    ACT_RUNPOS = 13,      /* Run to an arbitrary position. */
    ACT_PATROL = 14,      /* Follow a configured patrol path. */
    ACT_GOPOS = 15,       /* Pathfind to a target position/tile. */
    ACT_SURRENDER = 16,   /* Surrender animation/state. */
    ACT_LOOKATTARGET = 17,/* Look-at-target animation/state. */
    ACT_SURPRISED = 18,   /* Surprise or fluster animation. */
    ACT_STARTALARM = 19,  /* Reach for an alarm. */
    ACT_THROWGRENADE = 20,/* Grenade-throw animation/state. */
    ACT_TURNDIR = 21,     /* Scripted turn. */
    ACT_TEST = 22,        /* Internal/test action. */
    ACT_BONDINTRO = 23,   /* Single-player intro action. */
    ACT_BONDDIE = 24,     /* Single-player death action. */
    ACT_BONDMULTI = 25,   /* Multiplayer player-model action. */
    ACT_NULL = 26,        /* No action. */
    ACT_TYPE_MAX = 27
} ACT_TYPE;
```

The action union is model- and animation-coupled. Restoring its bytes without
also restoring the selected model animation can make the action tick interpret
incompatible state. Pointer members also cannot be restored as addresses.

## Action records

All action members overlay the same 120-byte region at `ChrRecord` offset
`0x2c`. Unlisted bytes in shorter records are inactive union storage, not
independent fields.

### `act_init`, `act_kneel`, and marker-only actions

```c
struct act_init         { int padding[30]; };
struct act_kneel        { int padding[30]; };
struct act_surrender    { int padding[30]; };
struct act_lookattarget { int padding[30]; };
struct act_startalarm   { int padding[30]; };
struct act_turndir      { int padding[30]; };
struct act_test         { int padding[30]; };
struct act_bondintro    { int padding[30]; };
struct act_bonddie      { int padding[30]; };
struct act_null         { int padding[30]; };
```

These declarations reserve the full union size but do not describe distinct
fields for the named action. Their behavior is selected by `actiontype` and,
where applicable, the current `Model` animation. The decompilation sometimes
accesses known fields through `act_init.padding`: `[0]` aliases the first field
of `act_dead`, `act_die`, and `act_argh`; `[1]` and `[3]` alias
`act_anim.holdLastFrame` and `idleOnEnd`; and `[0x13]` aliases
`act_patrol.lastvisible60`. These are alternate views of typed fields, not
independent padding state.

TODO: Determine whether any remaining bytes have action-specific meaning for
`ACT_INIT`, `ACT_KNEEL`, `ACT_SURRENDER`, `ACT_LOOKATTARGET`,
`ACT_STARTALARM`, `ACT_TURNDIR`, `ACT_TEST`, `ACT_BONDINTRO`, or
`ACT_BONDDIE` before serializing these actions.

### `act_stand`

Idle/standing state, including current facing and re-aim work.

```c
struct act_stand {
    s32 prestand;         /* 0x00 - Boolean: entered standing from kneeling. */
    s32 face_entitytype;  /* 0x04 - Entity/attack target bitfield; 0 means none. */
    s32 face_entityid;    /* 0x08 - ID interpreted according to face_entitytype. */
    s32 reaim;            /* 0x0c - Boolean/state requesting weapon re-aim. */
    s32 turning;          /* 0x10 - Turn state; initialized to 2. */
    u32 checkfacingwall;  /* 0x14 - Boolean: check/correct facing into walls. */
    s32 wallcount;        /* 0x18 - Countdown until the next wall-facing check. */
    f32 mergetime;        /* 0x1c - Inactive/uninitialized in GoldenEye. */
    s8  face_target;      /* 0x20 - Inactive/uninitialized in GoldenEye. */
};
```

`face_entitytype` uses the same target-selection bits as `ATTACKTYPE` where the
standing code aims at an entity: Bond `0x01`, forward `0x02`, character `0x04`,
pad `0x08`, direction `0x10`, aim-only `0x20`, do-not-turn `0x40`, and current
target `0x80`. Some standing paths also use `0x10` as a transient direction
target, so it must be interpreted with the active code path.

`prestand`, `reaim`, and `checkfacingwall` are Boolean values. `turning` uses
`1` while turning, `2` when the animation frame has reached its terminal
frame, and `3` when the requested heading has been reached; stand
initialization starts it at `2`. `wallcount` starts at a random value from
180 through 299 and is reduced on stand updates until a new facing check is
performed. `mergetime` and `face_target` have no reads, writes, or
initialization in the GoldenEye codebase; they are inactive union bytes and
are deliberately not serialized.

### `act_anim`

Parameters for an AI-requested animation. The live `Model` holds the actual
animation pointer, frame, speed, loop, and interpolation state.

```c
struct act_anim {
    u32 unk02c;        /* 0x00 - Boolean from ANIM_UNKNOWN (0x01). */
    u32 holdLastFrame; /* 0x04 - Boolean from ANIM_LOOP_HOLD_LAST_FRAME. */
    u32 playSfx;       /* 0x08 - Boolean from ANIM_PLAY_SFX. */
    u32 idleOnEnd;     /* 0x0c - Boolean from ANIM_IDLE_POSE_WHEN_COMPLETE. */
    u32 noTranslate;   /* 0x10 - Boolean from ANIM_NO_TRANSLATION. */
    u8  unk040;        /* 0x14 - TODO: determine purpose and values. */
    u8  unk041;        /* 0x15 - TODO: determine purpose and values. */
    u16 unk042;        /* 0x16 - TODO: determine purpose and values. */
    u16 unk044;        /* 0x18 - TODO: determine purpose and values. */
    u16 unk046;        /* 0x1a - TODO: determine purpose and values. */
    s16 animnum;       /* 0x1c - Animation-table index. */
    u8  flip;          /* 0x1e - Boolean: mirror the animation. */
    f32 startframe;    /* 0x20 - First animation frame. */
    f32 endframe;      /* 0x24 - Last animation frame; negative means default end. */
    f32 unk054;        /* 0x28 - TODO: determine purpose and values. */
    f32 unk058;        /* 0x2c - TODO: determine purpose and values. */
};
```

### `act_die`

State for an active death animation, including sound-trigger frames and
post-impact motion.

```c
struct act_die {
    s32     notifychrindex;     /* 0x00 - Character ID to notify; 0 means none. */
    f32     thudframe1;         /* 0x04 - First thud SFX frame; -1 after firing/none. */
    f32     thudframe2;         /* 0x08 - Second thud SFX frame; -1 after firing/none. */
    f32     timeextra;          /* 0x0c - Duration of extra impact movement. */
    f32     elapseextra;        /* 0x10 - Elapsed extra-movement time. */
    coord3d extraspeed;         /* 0x14 - Extra velocity from the killing impact. */
    s16     drcarollimagedelay; /* 0x20 - Delay before special death imagery. */
};
```

TODO: Confirm the units and terminal value for `drcarollimagedelay`, and whether
`notifychrindex == 0` is always the no-notification sentinel.

### `act_dead`

Corpse lifetime state.

```c
struct act_dead {
    bool allowfade;      /* 0x00 - Boolean; nonzero permits corpse fading. */
    bool allowreap;      /* 0x04 - Boolean; nonzero permits corpse removal. */
    s32  reaptimer;      /* 0x08 - Countdown/time controlling removal. */
    s32  fadetimer;      /* 0x0c - Countdown/time controlling alpha fade. */
    s32  notifychrindex; /* 0x10 - Character ID to notify, or no-target sentinel. */
};
```

Loading this record alone is unsafe: fade alpha, model state, held items, prop
existence, and mission death bookkeeping are coupled to it.

### `act_argh`

Immediate damage-flinch state.

```c
struct act_argh {
    s32 notifychrindex; /* 0x00 - Character ID to notify; initialized to 0. */
    s32 unk30;          /* 0x04 - Global tick captured for the hit reaction. */
};
```

### `act_preargh`

Deferred hit information consumed when the character transitions into a flinch
or death action.

```c
struct act_preargh {
    coord3d pos;    /* 0x00 - World-space hit position. */
    f32     unk038; /* 0x0c - Relative shot angle. */
    s32     unk03c; /* 0x10 - Model hit-part index. */
    s32     unk040; /* 0x14 - ITEM_IDS weapon ID which caused the hit. */
    u32     unk044; /* 0x18 - TODO: determine purpose and values. */
};
```

### `act_attack`

Stationary aiming/firing state. Most unnamed fields are animation phase,
per-hand timing, and aiming interpolation state.

```c
struct act_attack {
    struct weapon_firing_animation_table *animfloats; /* 0x00 - Static table row. */
    s8  unk30, unk31, unk32, unk33;                   /* 0x04 - TODO. */
    s8  unk34, unk35, unk36, unk37;                   /* 0x08 - TODO. */
    s8  unk38[2], unk3a[2];                           /* 0x0c - Per-hand state. */
    s8  unk3c[2], unk3e, unk3f;                       /* 0x10 - Per-hand/state bytes. */
    u32 unk40;                                         /* 0x14 - TODO. */
    s32 unk44;                                         /* 0x18 - Previous/related attack time. */
    s32 attack_time;                                   /* 0x1c - Attack elapsed/countdown ticks. */
    u32 attacktype;                                    /* 0x20 - ATTACKTYPE bitfield. */
    u32 entityid;                                      /* 0x24 - Target ID for CHR/PAD/DIRECTION. */
    u32 unk54;                                         /* 0x28 - TODO. */
    s32 type_of_motion;                                /* 0x2c - Re-aim/motion state. */
    u32 unk5C, unk60, unk64, unk68, unk6c;             /* 0x30 - TODO. */
    u32 unk70, unk74, unk78, unk7c;                    /* 0x44 - TODO. */
    s8  attack_item;                                   /* 0x54 - ITEM_IDS weapon ID. */
    u8  unk81, unk82, unk83;                           /* 0x55 - TODO. */
};
```

Valid `attacktype` bits are `ATTACKTYPE_BOND` (`0x01`),
`ATTACKTYPE_FORWARD` (`0x02`), `ATTACKTYPE_CHR` (`0x04`),
`ATTACKTYPE_PAD` (`0x08`), `ATTACKTYPE_DIRECTION` (`0x10`),
`ATTACKTYPE_AIMONLY` (`0x20`), `ATTACKTYPE_DONTTURN` (`0x40`), and
`ATTACKTYPE_TARGET` (`0x80`); zero means no attack target.

`animfloats` points into static weapon animation tables, but it must eventually
be encoded as a stable table identity/index rather than saved as an address.

TODO: Name and determine the possible values of the remaining attack fields
before this action is serialized.

### `act_attackwalk`

Moving attack state. It parallels `act_attack` but adds movement speed and
separate clocks.

```c
struct act_attackwalk {
    u32 unk02c;                          /* 0x00 - TODO. */
    s32 clock_timer30, clock_timer34;    /* 0x04 - Action clocks/timers. */
    u32 unk038;                          /* 0x0c - TODO. */
    struct weapon_firing_animation_table *animfloats; /* 0x10 - Static table row. */
    s32 timer40;                         /* 0x14 - Action timer. */
    s32 unk044;                          /* 0x18 - TODO. */
    s8  unk48[2], unk4a[2], unk4C[2];   /* 0x1c - Per-hand/action bytes. */
    u8  flip;                            /* 0x22 - Boolean animation mirror. */
    s8  unk4f;                           /* 0x23 - TODO. */
    s32 unk50;                           /* 0x24 - TODO. */
    f32 speed;                           /* 0x28 - Current movement speed. */
    u32 unk58, unk5C, unk60, unk64;      /* 0x2c - TODO. */
    u32 unk68, unk6c, unk70, unk74;      /* 0x3c - TODO. */
    u32 unk78, unk7c;                    /* 0x4c - TODO. */
    s8  attack_item;                     /* 0x54 - ITEM_IDS weapon ID. */
    u8  unk81, unk82, unk83;             /* 0x55 - TODO. */
};
```

TODO: Determine the meaning and valid ranges of the unnamed fields and how the
movement state synchronizes with `ChrRecord::prevpos`, `fallspeed`, and the
model animation.

### `act_attackroll`

Evasive-roll attack state. Its leading firing fields parallel `act_attack`;
the middle arrays hold roll-specific state.

```c
struct act_attackroll {
    struct weapon_firing_animation_table *animfloats; /* 0x00 - Static table row. */
    s8  unk30, unk31, unk32, unk33;                   /* 0x04 - TODO. */
    s8  unk34, unk35, unk36, unk37;                   /* 0x08 - TODO. */
    s8  unk38[2], unk3a[2];                           /* 0x0c - Per-hand state. */
    s8  unk3c[2], unk3e, unk3f;                       /* 0x10 - Per-hand/state bytes. */
    u32 unk40;                                         /* 0x14 - TODO. */
    s32 unk44;                                         /* 0x18 - Previous/related attack time. */
    s32 attack_time;                                   /* 0x1c - Attack elapsed/countdown ticks. */
    s32 unk4c[2], unk54[2];                            /* 0x20 - Roll-specific state. */
    u32 unk5C, unk60, unk64, unk68, unk6c;             /* 0x30 - TODO. */
    u32 unk70, unk74, unk78, unk7c;                    /* 0x44 - TODO. */
    s8  attack_item;                                   /* 0x54 - ITEM_IDS weapon ID. */
    u8  unk81, unk82, unk83;                           /* 0x55 - TODO. */
};
```

TODO: Determine the meaning and possible values of all unnamed roll fields.

### `act_sidestep` and `act_jumpout`

```c
struct act_sidestep { bool side; }; /* Inactive/uninitialized in GoldenEye. */
struct act_jumpout  { bool side; }; /* Inactive/uninitialized in GoldenEye. */
```

GoldenEye never reads or assigns either declared `side` member. Direction is
encoded by the live animation identity and `Model::gunhand`/flip byte instead.
These actions therefore have no serialized union payload; restoring their
action discriminator and model controller is complete for the current code.

### `act_runpos`

Direct movement toward an arbitrary point.

```c
struct act_runpos {
    coord3d pos;       /* 0x00 - Destination in world coordinates. */
    f32     neardist;  /* 0x0c - Arrival radius; initialized to 30.0. */
    s32     eta60;     /* 0x10 - Estimated ticks remaining; counts down to zero. */
    f32     turnspeed; /* 0x14 - Current turn interpolation/speed. */
};
```

### `patrol_path`

Runtime patrol-path descriptor referenced by `act_patrol`.

```c
struct patrol_path {
    s32 *data;  /* 0x00 - Pointer to path waypoint IDs. */
    u8   unk04; /* 0x04 - TODO: determine purpose and values. */
    u8   flags; /* 0x05 - TODO: determine path flag bits. */
    u16  len;   /* 0x06 - Number of path entries. */
};
```

The path and its `data` are pointers and need stable IDs/offsets. Do not save
their addresses.

### `waydata`

Incremental path-travel state embedded by patrol and go-to-position actions.

```c
struct waydata {
    s8      mode;         /* 0x00 - WAYMODE_0..WAYMODE_5 or WAYMODE_MAGIC (0-6). */
    s8      unk01;        /* 0x01 - Candidate/next mode; TODO. */
    s8      unk02;        /* 0x02 - Boolean/state associated with pos; TODO. */
    s8      unk03;        /* 0x03 - Boolean/state associated with pos_copy; TODO. */
    coord3d pos;          /* 0x04 - Current path segment position. */
    coord3d pos2;         /* 0x10 - Secondary segment position; TODO verify. */
    coord3d pos3;         /* 0x1c - Tertiary segment position. */
    s32     age;          /* 0x28 - Number of updates in current path state. */
    coord3d pos_copy;     /* 0x2c - Saved/copy position used by travel logic. */
    f32     segdistdone;  /* 0x38 - Distance completed in cheap travel mode. */
    f32     segdisttotal; /* 0x3c - Total segment distance in cheap travel mode. */
};
```

Modes `0` through `5` are phases of normal incremental navigation.
`WAYMODE_MAGIC` (`6`) selects the cheaper off-screen path-travel method.
TODO: Give semantic names to modes `0` through `5` after their transition
conditions are fully understood.

### `act_patrol`

Configured path patrol state.

```c
struct act_patrol {
    struct patrol_path *path; /* 0x00 - Active patrol descriptor. */
    s32  nextstep;            /* 0x04 - Next index in path->data. */
    bool forward;             /* 0x08 - Direction through the path. */
    struct waydata waydata;   /* 0x0c - Current segment travel state. */
    s32 lastvisible60;        /* 0x4c - Last global tick at which path was visible. */
    f32 speed;                /* 0x50 - Current patrol speed. */
    s32 unk80, unk84, unk88, unk8c; /* 0x54 - TODO. */
    s32 unk90, unk94, unk98, unk9c, unka0; /* 0x64 - TODO. */
};
```

Loading this action requires stable path identification and consistent
`waydata`, position, stand tile, room, and model movement state.

### `waypoint`

Static navigation-graph node referenced by `act_gopos`.

```c
typedef struct waypoint {
    s32  padID;       /* Pad anchoring this node. */
    s32 *neighbours;  /* -1-terminated neighbouring waypoint-ID array. */
    s32  groupNum;    /* Index of the containing waygroup. */
    s32  dist;        /* Mutable pathfinder heuristic/work distance. */
} waypoint;
```

Pointers to waypoints can be serialized only as indices into the level's
waypoint table. `neighbours` is static level data and is not CHR-owned.

### `act_gopos`

Pathfinding state for movement to a selected position/tile.

```c
struct act_gopos {
    coord3d targetpos;                         /* 0x00 - Final world destination. */
    StandTile *target;                         /* 0x0c - Final navigation tile. */
    waypoint  *target_path;                    /* 0x10 - Final waypoint. */
    waypoint  *waypoints[MAX_CHRWAYPOINTS];    /* 0x14 - Next path nodes. */
    u8         curindex;                       /* 0x2c - Current entry; normally 0-2. */
    u8         unk59;                          /* 0x2d - Flags/room guess; TODO. */
    u16        unk5a;                          /* 0x2e - Clock/restart value; TODO. */
    struct waydata waydata;                    /* 0x30 - Current segment state. */
    s32        unk9c;                          /* 0x70 - Last path update tick. */
    f32        speed;                          /* 0x74 - Current movement speed. */
};
```

When `curindex` reaches 3 the route is recalculated and the waypoint array is
replaced. `target` must use a stand-tile offset and waypoint pointers must use
level-table indices; raw addresses are unsafe.

### `act_surprised`

```c
struct act_surprised {
    u32 type; /* Inactive/uninitialized in GoldenEye. */
};
```

GoldenEye never reads or assigns `type`. Spotting, surrendering, and
looking-around variants are selected directly through `Model::anim`, so this
action has no serialized union payload.

### `act_throwgrenade`

Target and hand state for grenade throwing.

```c
struct act_throwgrenade {
    u32  entitytype; /* TODO: determine target selector values. */
    u32  entityid;   /* TODO: determine ID interpretation and sentinels. */
    u32  hand;       /* TODO: determine whether this is a GUNHAND value. */
    bool needsequip; /* TODO: verify meaning; expected Boolean storage. */
};
```

No GoldenEye consumer currently references these named members; the throw
animation is driven by the model and other CHR state. Do not serialize inferred
semantics until the fields are identified.

### `act_bondmulti`

Multiplayer player-model animation state.

```c
struct act_bondmulti {
    f32 *unk2c; /* Pointer to animation data; exact table type is unknown. */
    s32  unk30, unk34, unk38, unk3c; /* Animation state; TODO. */
    int  padding[25];                /* Unnamed remainder of union storage. */
};
```

The animation pointer needs a stable table identity/index. TODO: identify the
pointed-to table and document the named state fields before serialization.

### Raw action aliases

```c
struct act_bytes  { s8 padding[120]; };
struct act_ubytes { u8 padding[120]; };
```

These are decompilation views of the same union bytes, not distinct runtime
action types. Known accesses include byte `84`, which aliases `attack_item` in
the attack records, and byte `45`, which aliases an action-dependent value used
as a hit-sound selector. They must not be serialized in addition to the
selected typed member. TODO: identify the typed field represented by byte 45.

## Other supporting records

### `weapon_firing_animation_table`

Static aiming/firing interpolation data referenced by `act_attack`,
`act_attackwalk`, and `act_attackroll`.

```c
struct weapon_firing_animation_table {
    s32 anonymous_0;
    f32 anonymous_1,  anonymous_2,  anonymous_3,  anonymous_4;
    f32 anonymous_5,  anonymous_6,  anonymous_7,  anonymous_8;
    f32 anonymous_9,  anonymous_10, anonymous_11, anonymous_12;
    f32 anonymous_13;
    f32 anonymous_14; /* Minimum used by chrlvUpdateAimendsideback. */
    f32 anonymous_15; /* Maximum used by chrlvUpdateAimendsideback. */
    f32 anonymous_16, anonymous_17;
};
```

Rows live in static weapon/stance-specific tables. The pointer is reconstructible
in principle, but the table and row need stable identifiers. TODO: determine
the meaning and range of all columns before serializing attack actions.

### `ChrRecord_f180`

Per-hand cache used while calculating and rendering weapon beam/tracer
endpoints. `ChrRecord::unk180[0]` is the right-hand cache and `[1]` is the
left-hand cache.

```c
typedef struct ChrRecord_f180 {
    s8      unk00;   /* Cache/activity state; initialized to -1 (inactive). */
    s8      item_id; /* ITEM_IDS value associated with the cached shot. */
    char    unk02;   /* TODO: determine purpose and values. */
    char    unk03;   /* TODO: determine purpose and values. */
    coord3d pos;     /* Cached beam endpoint/origin position. */
    coord3d delta;   /* Cached beam direction/delta. */
    f32     unk1c;   /* TODO: beam-length/interpolation value. */
    f32     unk20;   /* TODO: determine purpose and values. */
    f32     unk24;   /* TODO: determine purpose and values. */
    f32     unk28;   /* TODO: determine purpose and values. */
} ChrRecord_f180;
```

This is transient visual/weapon state and is not part of the conservative
first save/load slice.
