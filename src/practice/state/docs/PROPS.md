# Prop System State Save/Load

This document logs our findings, analysis, and specifications for GoldenEye 007's prop system and how to save/load the states of various props.

## Prop System Overview

In GoldenEye 007, everything in the level that is not static level geometry (the room meshes) is represented as a **prop**. This includes characters (guards, scientists, Bond), doors, ammunition crates, weapons on the ground, surveillance cameras, drone guns, body armor, and even transient entities like explosions and smoke.

### Active Props List

- Props are globally allocated in a flat array:
    ```c
    PropRecord pos_data_entry[POS_DATA_ENTRY_LEN]; // POS_DATA_ENTRY_LEN = 600
    ```
- Active props in the world are chained in a doubly linked list using the `prev` and `next` pointers within the `PropRecord` structure.
- The entry points to this linked list are defined as:
    ```c
    extern PropRecord *ptr_obj_pos_list_first_entry; // Head
    extern PropRecord *ptr_obj_pos_list_current_entry; // Tail
    ```
- Active-list membership and `PROPFLAG_ENABLED` are distinct. Most active props
  are enabled, but a respawning pickup is disabled without being delisted so
  its `timetoregen` continues to tick. Inactive setup objects may also retain a
  live `obj->prop` binding. Save/free-list code must account for both cases.
- Room membership is also indexed separately through
  `RoomPropListChunkIndexes` and `RoomPropListChunks`. These tables are derived
  from root props' `rooms[]` lists by `chrpropRegisterRooms`; they are not
  serialized as authoritative state. Save-state loading clears them before prop
  replacement and rebuilds them after props, attachments, and the player/viewer
  prop are restored. This prevents loading gameplay from a level-end cutscene
  from leaving stale room chunk data that makes `roomGetProps` return garbage
  prop indices.

## Primary Structures

### `PropRecord`

The container struct representing any prop in the 3D game world.

```c
typedef struct PropRecord
{
    u8  type;        /* 0x00 - PROP_TYPE enum */
    u8  flags;       /* 0x01 - Bitflags:
                      *   0x01: PROPFLAG_RENDERPOSTBG (Render in foreground)
                      *   0x02: PROPFLAG_ONSCREEN     (Prop currently visible on-screen)
                      *   0x04: PROPFLAG_ENABLED      (Prop active/in-use in the world)
                      */
    s16 timetoregen; // 0x02 - Respawn ticks remaining (used for weapons/ammo in multiplayer/resets)
    union
    {
        struct ChrRecord       *chr;
        struct ObjectRecord    *obj;
        struct DoorRecord      *door;

    struct PropRecord *prev;                            /* 0x24 - Previous active prop when parent is NULL;

    struct PropRecord *next;                            /* 0x28 - Next active prop when parent is NULL;

} PropRecord;
```

### Prop Types (`PROP_TYPE`)

Each `PropRecord` defines its entity type in its `type` field:

- `PROP_TYPE_NUL` (0): Null / unused.
- `PROP_TYPE_OBJ` (1): Interactive game objects (crates, armor, computers, etc. - uses `obj`). Save/load implemented.
- `PROP_TYPE_DOOR` (2): Doors (uses `door`). Save/load implemented.
- `PROP_TYPE_CHR` (3): Characters/NPCs (uses `chr`). Partial save/load
  implemented for the initial scalar AI field set.
- `PROP_TYPE_WEAPON` (4): Weapon pickups, thrown weapons, and mines in the world (uses `weapon`). Save/load implemented.
- `PROP_TYPE_PLAYER` (5): Player (uses `chr`).
- `PROP_TYPE_VIEWER` (6): Multi-player/cutscene viewer (uses `chr`).
- `PROP_TYPE_EXPLOSION` (7): Active explosion effects (uses `explosion`). Save/load implemented.
- `PROP_TYPE_SMOKE` (8): Smoke clouds (uses `smoke`). Save/load implemented.

## Entity Records

### `PropDefHeaderRecord`

The header structure embedded at the beginning of all entity definition records (objects, doors, weapons, etc.).

```c
typedef struct PropDefHeaderRecord
{
    u16 extrascale; /* 0x00 - Scale multiplier in fixed-point u8.8 format (e.g. 0x0380 = 3.5x scale) */
    u8  state;      /* 0x02 - Bitflags tracking the damage, destruction, and interactive state:
                     *   0x01: PROPSTATE_DAMAGED (Object has taken damage)
                     *   0x04: PROPSTATE_RESPAWN (Object respawning enabled in multiplayer)
                     *   0x08: PROPSTATE_EXT_COLISION_BLOCK (Externally allocated collision block present)
                     *   0x40: PROPSTATE_ACTIVATED (Console/datathief/decoder active or triggered)
                     *   0x80: PROPSTATE_DESTROYED (Object is completely destroyed)
                     */
    u8  type;       /* 0x03 - Category type ID used by level preset loaders */
} PropDefHeaderRecord;
```

---

### 1. `ObjectRecord` (PROP_TYPE_OBJ)

The base record for interactive stage objects. Note that many other specific object types (doors, monitors, keycards, drone guns) extend/inherit `ObjectRecord` anonymously.

```c
typedef struct ObjectRecord
{
    inherits    PropDefHeaderRecord;              /* 0x00 - Unnamed header struct (type, state, scale) */
    s16         obj;                              /* 0x04 - Prop definition/model ID enum (e.g. PROP_ALARM1) */
    s16         pad;                              /* 0x06 - The stage pad index this object is placed at */
    u32         flags;                            /* 0x08 - Object setup/configuration flag bits:

                                                   *   0x40000000: Weapon has no ammo on pickup / Doors: area behind door always visible

### 3. `WeaponObjRecord` (PROP_TYPE_WEAPON) — Save/load implemented

A weapon or ammunition container resting on the ground, held by a character, or active as a thrown weapon or mine. Extends `ObjectRecord`. Top-level `PROP_TYPE_WEAPON` records use `PROPDEF_COLLECTABLE` as their object-definition type.

```c
typedef struct WeaponObjRecord
{
    inherits                ObjectRecord;         /* 0x00 - Inner ObjectRecord base structure */
    s8                      weaponnum;            /* 0x80 - ITEM_IDS value identifying the weapon/item.
                                                   * Values range from ITEM_UNARMED (0) through the
                                                   * weapon, gadget, key-item, and token IDs. */
    s8                      LinkedWeaponType;     /* 0x81 - ITEM_IDS value for the other weapon in a
                                                   * dual-wield pair. The game uses this when two
                                                   * weapon objects are linked so collecting them
                                                   * grants/records a dual-wield combination. A
                                                   * negative value means no linked weapon type. */
    s16                     timer;                /* 0x82 - Runtime countdown/state for thrown weapons.
                                                   * Grenades and timed mines count down to detonation;
                                                   * remote/proximity mines use 1 for armed, 0 to
                                                   * detonate, and -1 after detonation is requested. */
    struct WeaponObjRecord *dualweapon;           /* 0x84 - The other live weapon object in that
                                                   * dual-wield pair, or NULL.
                                                   * Serialized as its PropRecord array index and
                                                   * resolved back to the live WeaponObjRecord. */
} WeaponObjRecord;
```

The serializer also restores the inherited `ObjectRecord`, including transform, damage, model-switch visibility, projectile/embedment indices, and runtime flags. This preserves dropped or thrown weapon position and motion. `dualweapon` is not saved as an address because the address can become stale; it is converted to a stable prop index.

### 4. `ChrRecord` (PROP_TYPE_CHR)

The active runtime character entity representing guards, scientists, key targets, and multiplayer opponents.
The action-union and other supporting structs, pointer hazards, and the
conservative first field set selected for implementation are documented in
[`CHR.md`](CHR.md).

The implemented save/load slices restore
`accuracyrating`, `speedrating`, `arghrating`, `grenadeprob`, `visionrange`,
`hearingscale`, `morale`, `alertness`, `numarghs`, `numclosearghs`, `random`,
`padpreset1`, `chrpreset1`, `chrseeshot`, `chrseedie`,
`lastseetarget60`, `lastknowntargetpos`, `targetTile`, `seen_bond_time`, and
`lastheartarget60`, `chrnum`, `flags2`, `timer60`, the
`CHRHIDDEN_TIMER_ACTIVE` bit, `flinchcnt`, the four
`CHRHIDDEN_RAND_FLINCH_MASK` direction bits, the durable behavior/render
`chrflags` subset documented in `CHR.md`, `shotbondsum`, combat action/aiming state,
`firecount`, `aimendcount`, all eight shoulder/back angles, `fireslot_word`,
`field_178`, both `unk180` beam caches, combat/moving hidden bits, `shadecol`,
and `nextcol`. Dynamic `ptr_SEbuffer3`/`ptr_SEbuffer4` sound nodes are stopped
and cleared rather than serialized.
The AI interpreter fields `ailist`, `aioffset`, `aireturnlist`, and `sleep`
are also restored. Spatial restoration covers the CHR prop's position, stand
tile, rooms, model root transform, movement history, ground state, and
collision bounds. Equipment restoration covers both hand slots, the legacy
third slot when already valid, the hat pointer, CHR-owned prop hierarchy,
model attachment nodes, and `RUNTIMEBITFLAG_HASOWNER`. `flags2` is restored
completely; the timer, firing, tracer, and moving subsets of `hidden` are
restored. `targetTile` is
relocated through a stable stand-tile offset, while `ailist` is relocated
through a stable AI list ID. See `CHR.md` for the fields explicitly deferred
and the gated replacement architecture.

### 5. `Explosion` (PROP_TYPE_EXPLOSION) — Save/load implemented

A short-lived explosion effect which expands its damage volume, creates and animates flare sprites, optionally leaves a scorch mark, and eventually creates a smoke prop. Explosion records come from the fixed six-entry `g_ExplosionBuffer`.

`explosion_type` indexes `g_ExplosionTypes`, which defines damage and visual ranges, growth rates, lifetime, flare animation speed, shrapnel, smoke type, sound, and damage. Named values include `EXPLOSION_DEF_DRONE` (12), `EXPLOSION_DEF_STANDARD` (13, grenades and mines), `EXPLOSION_DEF_MASSIVE` (17), `EXPLOSION_DEF_PLAYER` (18), and `EXPLOSION_DEF_FACILITY_REMOTE` (19).

The serializer restores every non-pointer field and all 40 `ExplosionPart` records. `Explosion::prop` is preserved because the fixed buffer entry and live prop already point to each other. `Explosion::source` is serialized as a stable prop-array index and restored only if that prop is still enabled; otherwise it becomes `NULL`, which safely uses the explosion prop as the fallback location when follow-up smoke is created.

The associated `g_NumExplosionEntries` and `g_NumSmokeEntries` counters are also restored. Both normally range from 0 to 6 and control the short camera-shake sequence triggered by an explosion.

An explosion present in the save but missing from the current world is recreated in its saved slot using a free `g_ExplosionBuffer` entry (`create_explosion_prop`); one present in the world but absent from the save is removed. Explosions that were mid-effect are restored in place.

### 6. `Smoke` (PROP_TYPE_SMOKE) — Save/load implemented

A transient smoke cloud produced by an explosion or by a damaged object. Smoke records come from the fixed 20-entry `g_SmokeBuffer`; the associated prop points to its buffer entry and supplies the cloud's world position and rooms.

```c
struct SmokePart
{
    coord3d pos;    /* 0x00 - World position of this smoke sprite */
    f32 size;       /* 0x0C - Sprite size; 0.0 means this part is inactive */
    f32 rot;        /* 0x10 - Current sprite rotation in radians */
    f32 deltarot;   /* 0x14 - Rotation added on each update */
    f32 offset1;    /* 0x18 - First animated texture/noise offset */
    f32 offset2;    /* 0x1C - Second animated texture/noise offset */
    f32 alpha;      /* 0x20 - Current opacity; the part expires below 4.0 */
    s16 count;      /* 0x24 - Number of updates since this part appeared */
};

struct Smoke
{
    PropRecord      *prop;                    /* 0x000 - Back-pointer to the live smoke prop */
    s16              duration;                /* 0x004 - Number of smoke updates elapsed */
    s16              smoke_type;              /* 0x006 - Index 0-10 into g_SmokeTypes */
    struct SmokePart parts[SMOKE_PARTS_LEN];  /* 0x008 - Ten independently animated sprites */
};
```

`smoke_type` selects the duration, spawn/dissolve rates, size, rotation rates, colour, and cloud propagation duration from `g_SmokeTypes`. Values 0-7 are selected by explosion definitions; 8 and 9 are short-lived effects produced by damaged objects; 10 is the large cloud created while the tank fires. `duration` normally runs from 0 through the selected type's configured lifetime. Each part's `size` is the active marker, while `alpha` and `count` control its fade.

The serializer restores `duration`, `smoke_type`, and all ten `SmokePart` values. It deliberately preserves `Smoke::prop` rather than serializing its address: the live smoke prop and its fixed buffer slot already point to each other, and restoring an address is unnecessary and unsafe. A smoke cloud present in the save but missing from the current world is recreated in its saved slot using a free `g_SmokeBuffer` entry (`create_smoke_prop`); one present in the world but absent from the save is removed.

## Save/Load Guidelines

1. **Mapping Pointers to Indices/Offsets**:
    - `PropRecord *` targets are resolved to stable indices via `get_prop_index(prop)`.
    - `StandTile *` targets are converted to byte offsets from `standTileStart` using `get_tile_offset(tile)`.
2. **Audio System Nullification**:
    - Active sound state nodes (`ALSoundState *`) are dynamically allocated. On reload, these pointer members must be set to `NULL` to prevent crashes when the sound engine tries to modify a dead address.
3. **List Integrity**:
    - Care must be taken not to alter list linkage (`prev`/`next`) directly unless allocating/deallocating a prop, as list order and pointers are crucial to the engine’s update loop.
    - Equipment acquired by a CHR after the save must be freed during load, not detached and activated as a new dropped prop.
    - Missing setup-backed objects must be recreated from their saved setup-command index. Destroyable geometry such as Train's cuttable floor strips is fully freed during gameplay and its prop slots may be reused.
4. **Projectile/Embedment Union Integrity**:
    - `ObjectRecord::projectile` and `ObjectRecord::embedment` share one union slot. Restore only `projectile` for `RUNTIMEBITFLAG_DEPOSIT`, only `embedment` for `RUNTIMEBITFLAG_EMBEDDED`, or clear the slot and both flags when the saved index is invalid.
5. **Deferred Projectile Reference Resolution**:
    - Read saved `Projectile::ownerprop` and `Projectile::obj` indices into separate temporary arrays rather than casting them to pointers. Resolve them only after all prop records have been processed. If the object prop was collected or removed and is no longer enabled, mark the projectile free instead of retaining an invalid reference.
