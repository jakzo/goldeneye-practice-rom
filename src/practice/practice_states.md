# Save/Load States

This document logs our findings, analysis, and architecture specifications for the practice ROM's save/load state functionality, serving as a guide for future developers and AI agents.

You should update this document whenever new information is learned. Keep it concise and information-dense.

If you have been told to continue work on this feature, read the "current goal" section below to understand what we want to achieve. Also look at the key learnings and struct analysis for helpful information and leads to continue investigating.

Above all, make sure you investigate thoroughly to fully understand where pieces of data are used, their purpose and the implications of setting them to certain values on load. Once confident about a piece of data, add it to the save/load system, document your findings in this file, and stop and tell the user about what you found and how they can test it. Do not continue work unless the user explicitly tells you to.

## Current Goal

Currently we want to be able to save and load details about the player in a single player game. Things like position, orientation, velocity, ammo, inventory, health, etc.

## Key Learnings

Add any general advice helpful for future agents working on this feature here. Be sure to read and understand these before starting work on handling more state in the system.

- **Implement one feature at a time then manually test**: Since crashes and hangs are so common and can be unexpectedly caused by even seemingly innocuous changes, implement a small number of safe properties in the save/load code. After this, update this file and report back to the user what was added, what was learned and what they should now do in the game to test that the newly added properties are loaded correctly.
- **Stale Pointers**: Any struct member ending in `*` (e.g., `ALSoundState *`, `ObjectRecord *`, `PropRecord *`) is an absolute memory address. If the game engine deallocates or reallocates the target object, loading a saved state that retains the old pointer will cause a crash. All such pointers must either be relocated (mapped back to correct indices) or it will not affect gameplay nullified (set to `NULL`).
- **Sound System Crashing**: Sound structures (`ALSoundState`) are allocated dynamically. Nullifying properties like `audioHandle`, `openSoundState`, and `closeSoundState` upon loading prevents the sound engine from trying to modify a defunct sound node.
- **NULL Prop Handling (Cutscenes vs Gameplay)**: The player's world physical presence `g_CurrentPlayer->prop` is `NULL` during intro cutscenes, level loading, or death. When loading a saved state:
  - Track whether the saved state had a valid prop using a `has_prop` boolean flag.
  - If the saved state has a prop but the current player does not (e.g., loading gameplay into a cutscene), allocate a new prop using `chrpropAllocate()`, initialize its fields, activate it, enable it, and register it to its rooms.
  - If the saved state does not have a prop but the current player does (e.g., loading a cutscene into active gameplay), deregister, delist, disable, and free the current player prop using `chrpropDeregisterRooms`, `chrpropDelist`, `chrpropDisable`, and `chrpropFree`.
  - If both have a prop, update its coordinates and rooms safely using room deregistration/registration.


## Struct Analysis

Keep all the properties of the structs and global variables we save and load here. Document them and their properties, along with whether they affect gameplay, their status in the save/load code and any other important information. Use this as a guide when reading source code to understand what each property does.

If you are missing any information about a struct or variable, mark with a TODO comment what should still be investigated and documented.

```c
// player.c / player.h
// Global reference to the active player state (for the current player viewport).
// Also referenced in the g_playerPointers[4] array indexed by player_num.
struct player *g_CurrentPlayer;

// bondview.h
// State of the player (Bond).
struct player {
  // Saved: yes
  // Flag indicating player control state / viewport focus.
  // Values: 1 (bypasses collision and portal calculations, returning raw position coordinates directly, e.g. during cutscenes or frozen camera tick), 0 (normal gameplay mode where logical position is calculated from collision structures).

  // Pointer to the level geometry StandTile the player is currently on.
  // Address Safety: Safe to load *within the same level run*, as level geometry StandTiles are loaded statically on stage load and do not move or deallocate during gameplay. However, loading a state from a different level or after reloading the level is unsafe because the tiles are reallocated in memory.

  // Pointer to the player's world PropRecord which tracks its position, active stand tile, and registered rooms in the game's spatial grid.
  // Address Safety: The pointer itself is safe to load within the same level run. However, moving the player prop requires deregistering it from its old rooms (using `chrpropDeregisterRooms`) and registering it to its new rooms (using `chrpropRegisterRooms`) to prevent coordinate-room desync and crashes.
