The original README for the decompilation is at [readme-original.md](readme-original.md) and contains instructions for building, etc.

All new logic for the practice ROM is stored in the files under `src/practice`. If logic needs to be added to existing files, it should be added within an `#ifdef PRACTICE_ROM` block. If any lines are modified, the modified lines should exist in the `#ifdef` block with the original still existing, unmodified in the `#else` block. This is so that changes to the original code are easy to find and compare to original. `#include` directives do not need to be in `#ifdef` blocks.

To avoid distributing copyrighted material, only patch files are to be included in this repository and saved by CI for download. No ready-made ROMs of Goldeneye.
